Here's a Spring Boot challenge for a Bus System:

Challenge: Bus Management System

Create a Spring Boot application that manages bus operations for a transportation company. The system should allow administrators to:

Register Buses: Add new buses to the system with details such as bus number, route, capacity, and driver information.
Assign Routes: Assign buses to specific routes, including start and end points, and scheduled departure times.
Manage Schedules: Create and manage bus schedules, including frequency, departure times, and arrival times.
Track Bus Locations: Display the current location of each bus on a map (using a library like Leaflet or Google Maps).
Handle Bookings: Allow passengers to book tickets for specific routes and buses, including seat selection and payment processing.
Generate Reports: Provide reports on bus performance, including on-time arrival rates, passenger numbers, and revenue generated.

Requirements:
Use Spring Boot 2.x as the application framework.
Implement user authentication and authorization using Spring Security.
Use a database (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL) to store bus, route, schedule, and booking data.
Create RESTful APIs for bus registration, route assignment, schedule management, and booking management.
Use a mapping library (e.g., ModelMapper) to map between entity objects and DTOs.
Implement data validation using Bean Validation (JSR-303).
Use a logging framework (e.g., Logback) for logging application events.
Write unit tests and integration tests for the application using JUnit and Spring Test.


Deliverables:
A fully functional Spring Boot application with the required features.
A detailed README file explaining the application's architecture, dependencies, and usage.
A set of unit tests and integration tests to verify the application's functionality.
Evaluation Criteria:
Correctness and completeness of the implementation.
Code quality, organization, and maintainability.
Adherence to Spring Boot best practices and conventions.
Thoroughness and effectiveness of testing.
